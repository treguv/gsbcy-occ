# GSBCY OCC
## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a platform that allows you to easily find the codes for (and eventually track) all the boxes our church put together as a contriubution to Operation Christmas Child. Seeing as the number was over 100, keeping track of all the little tickets with tracking information individually would be a great challenge. So that is why this webpage aims to condense them all into one place.
